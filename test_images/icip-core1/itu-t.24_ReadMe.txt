The three images in the directory "converted-to-ppm"
are identical to the images taken from the ITU-T.24 test image
set in the directory original, but have been converted to ppm for
your convenience. Please use the ppm versions for performance
tests. The ITU test images are available under their orginal
license, see original/Readme.txt for details.

Other images from ITU-T.24 are not included in the test image
set of the ICIP challenge because the organizers felt that they
might no longer be appropriate due to resolution and contents.
